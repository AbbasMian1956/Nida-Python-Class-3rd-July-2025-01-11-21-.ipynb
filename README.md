# 🐍 Python Practice – List & Tuple Methods

## 📌 Description
This notebook contains hands-on practice with **List** and **Tuple** data structures in Python. It was created as part of a class session to demonstrate how to manipulate, access, and understand the behavior of these two essential sequence types.

The notebook includes:
- List creation and printing
- Adding elements using `append()` and `extend()`
- Removing elements using `remove()`, `pop()`, and `del`
- Clearing lists using `clear()`
- Tuple creation and indexing
- Tuple slicing and negative indexing
- Difference between `list` and `tuple`
- Type conversion from `list` to `tuple` and vice versa

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 🧠 What I Learned
- The differences between mutable (lists) and immutable (tuples) types
- How to properly manipulate elements in a list
- How indexing and slicing works in both lists and tuples
- How to confirm data types using `type()`
- The importance of syntax when creating a tuple with a single element
